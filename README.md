R files for Computational Genomics final project

All code was written in R.  The following R files are available on GitHub:

- project_code_MatrixFact: This file contains all code used to perform the matrix factorization method and evaluate on simulated and actual data. Code used to generate the simulated data is also provide, but commented out, as the data set is provided in the RData file.  Code used to evaluate the method on actual data is also commented out.  Running this code with the RData file will test the method on the simulated data.

- data_MatrixFact: This data file contains simulated data (samplesSim) and the random matrix used to generate the data (matrix100).  These data can be used to run the project_code_MatrixFact.R file.
